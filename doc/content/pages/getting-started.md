#### NIDM-Results

Export your mass-univariate neuroimaging results as NIDM-Results packs.

A *NIDM-Results pack* is a compressed file containing essential metadata describing the experiment as well as key image files summarising the statistical results in compliance with [NIDM-Results specification](http://nidm.nidash.org/specs/nidm-results.html).
