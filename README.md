## NeuroImaging Data Model (NIDM)

A model to represent all neuroimaging data and metadata! 

NIDM provides structured representations of neuroimaging data with the goal of supporting data sharing in the neuroimaging community. 
 
![alt text](http://nidm.nidash.org/specs/img/nidm-layer-cake.png "NIDM components")

NIDM is currently made up of 3 components:
 - **NIDM-Results**: software-agnostic representation of GLM results
 - **NIDM-Workflows**: representation of neuroimaging workflows
 - **NIDM-Experiment**: representation of neuroimaging raw data
and is described an extension the [W3C PROV](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/) standard for provenance.

## Getting Started

The goal of this repo is to foster collaboration among the developers working on NIDM, other repositories include: 

 * NIDM-Results: [NIDM-Results python library](https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidmresults), [FSL to NIDM-Results](https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidmresults-fsl), [SPM to NIDM-Results](https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidmresults-spm), [View NIDM-Results in SPM](https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidmresults-spmhtml), [View NIDM-Results in FSL](https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidmresults-fslhtml)
 * NIDM-Experiment: [NIDM-Experiment python library](https://github.com/incf-nidash/pyNIDM)

## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to NIDM! 

The NIDM working group is a collaboration supported by the [INCF](http://www.incf.org). We meet every week by videoconference. The group is always open to new contributors who are interested in neuroimaging data sharing. To join the call or to ask any question, please email us at incf-nidash-nidm@googlegroups.com. There are many ways to contribute. To get started, take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
