        <skos:definition>Instrument (CDISC Clinical Research Glossary, v. 8.0): “A means to capture data (e.g., questionnaire, diary) plus all the information and documentation that support its use. NOTE: Generally, instruments include clearly defined methods and instructions for administration or responding, a standard format for data collection, and well-documented methods for scoring, analysis, and interpretation of results.”
&quot;Testing procedures are normally designed to be administered under carefully controlled or standardised conditions that embody systematic scoring protocols&quot; (Source: ITC International Guidelines for Test Use, http://www.intestcom.org/Guidelines).
ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS are divided among PSYCHOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS, BEHAVIOURAL INSTRUMENTS, and NEUROCLINICAL INSTRUMENTS according to the kind of entity (a function or a behaviour) they explore.
ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS are divided among QUESTIONNAIRES and TEST-INSTRUMENTS according to their mode of administration and whether they involve sets of questions, or require the performance of tasks or operations.
ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS are divided among MONO-DOMAIN INSTRUMENTS and MULTI-DOMAINS INSTRUMENTS according to the number of DOMAINS they explore.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition>A BEHAVIOURAL INSTRUMENT explores the subject&#39;s behavior and provides normative data and consistent measures about intensity/severity of a behavioral trait. In this context, the instrument does not measure the subject performance to realize a specific task and questionnaires are generally used. Each INSTRUMENT VARIABLE of the QUESTIONNAIRE is associated to a SCALE and each subject&#39;s answer corresponds to a SCALE ITEM. Generally, BEHAVIOURAL INSTRUMENTS are QUESTIONNAIRES. However, some exceptions exist especially when the explored domain is at the frontier between cognition and behavior (e.g. executive functions such as motivation, planning or social interaction). In these rare cases BEHAVIOURAL INSTRUMENTS are similar to TEST-INSTRUMENTS.

        <skos:definition>NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS are used as tools in NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS to measure a psychological function known to be linked to a particular brain structure or pathway. 
“Neuropsychological tests are specifically designed tasks used to measure a psychological function known to be linked to a particular brain structure or pathway. They usually involve the systematic administration of clearly defined procedures in a formal environment. Neuropsychological tests are typically administered to a single person working with an examiner in a quiet office environment, free from distractions. As such, it can be argued that neuropsychological tests at times offer an estimate of a person&#39;s peak level of cognitive performance. Neuropsychological tests are a core component of the process of conducting neuropsychological assessment” (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org).

        <skos:definition>&quot;Neuropsychological assessment is a method of examining the brain by studying its behavioural product. Since the subject matter of neuropsychological assessment is behavior, it relies on many of the same techniques, assumptions, and theories as does psychological assessment. The distinctive character of neuropsychological assessment lies in a conceptual frame of reference that takes brain function as its point of departure. Regardless of whether a behavioral study is undertaken for clinical or research purposes, it is neuropsychological so long as the questions that prompted it, the central issues, the findings, or the inferences drawn from them ultimately relate to brain function&quot; (Lezak et al., 2004).</skos:definition>

A questionnaire-based assessment involves sets of questions (items), carried out in a structured way (known as structured interview) or semi-structured way, to provide normative data. Interview-based measures and rating scales are designed to be completed by clinicians, subjects, parents, caregivers. The scoring of each item contributes to the measure of the explored domain (e.g. Depression).
“A directed conversation with the subject aimed at eliciting information   for psychiatric diagnosis, evaluation, treatment planning, etc.   The interview may be conducted by a social worker or psychologist.” (Source: MSH/MH). (Concept: [CUI C0021819] Interview, Psychological,   Semantic Type:  Diagnostic Procedure).
QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED ASSESSMENTS are divided among PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVIEWS, BEHAVIOURAL INTERVIEWS, and NEUROCLINICAL INTERVIEWS according to the kind of questionnaire that is used.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition>“A rating scale is a set of categories designed to elicit information about a quantitative or a qualitative attribute in the social sciences” (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org).
“Scales can focus on different aspects of mood, behavior, and functional abilities”. (Source: Lezak et al., 2004).
“The &quot;levels of measurement&quot;, or scales of measure are expressions that typically refer to the theory of scale types developed by the psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens. Stevens proposed his theory in a 1946 Science article titled &quot;On the theory of scales of measurement&quot;. In that article, Stevens claimed that all measurement in science was conducted using four different types of scales that he called &quot;nominal&quot;, &quot;ordinal&quot;, &quot;interval&quot; and &quot;ratio&quot;. … As a matter of fact, most of the scales used widely and effectively by psychologists are ordinal scales. … Psychometricians like to theorise that psychometric tests produce interval scale measures of cognitive abilities (e.g. Lord &amp; Novick, 1968; von Eye, 2005) but there is little prima facie evidence to suggest that such attributes are anything more than ordinal for most psychological data (Cliff, 1996; Cliff &amp; Keats, 2003; Michell, 2008). …  There has been, and continues to be, debate about the merits of the classifications, particularly in the cases of the nominal and ordinal classifications (Michell, 1986). Thus, while Stevens&#39; classification is widely adopted, it is by no means universally accepted. …  The theory of scale types is the intellectual handmaiden to Stevens&#39; &quot;operational theory of measurement&quot;, which was to become definitive within psychology and the behavioral sciences, despite Michell&#39;s characterization as its being quite at odds with Michell&#39;s understanding of measurement in the natural sciences (Michell, 1999). Essentially, the operational theory of measurement was a reaction to the conclusions of a committee established in 1932 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to investigate the possibility of genuine scientific measurement in the psychological and behavioral sciences.” (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org). 
Example: The CODED VARIABLE of the INSTRUMENT ‘Beck Depression Inventory’ which measures the QUALITY  ‘Sadness’ has for scale the following 4-item SCALE: (&#39;I do not feel sad&#39;, &#39;I feel sad much of the time&#39;, &#39;I am sad all the time&#39;, &#39;I am so sad or unhappy that I can&#39;t stand it&#39;). This SCALE has for minimum scale item the SCALE ITEM: &#39;I do not feel sad&#39; and has for maximum scale item the SCALE ITEM: &#39;I am so sad or unhappy that I can&#39;t stand it&#39;.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition>During an observation, the process of approximating the observed QUALITY’s value (called QUALE in DOLCE) turns the continuous QUALE of the observed quality into a discrete approximation entity which is a SCALE ITEM. While the construction of the SCALE, a set of QUALITY&#39;s values are chosen and each of them is coded by a SCALE ITEM. Generally, a SCALE consists of 4 SCALE ITEMS (short version) or of  6 SCALE ITEMS (long version).
Example: In the INSTRUMENT ‘Beck Depression Inventory&#39;, the SCALE ITEM &#39;I feel sad much of the time&#39; belongs to the SCALE which is the scale of the CODED VARIABLE which measures the QUALITY  ‘Sadness’. This SCALE ITEM refers to a specific level of sadness.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition>“To make the comparisons necessary for evaluating impairment, test-makers generally reports scores as values of a scale based on the raw scores made by a standardization population (the group of individual tested for the purpose of obtaining normative data on the test). The scale that is most meaningful statistically is one derived from the normal probability curved and based on the standard deviation unit. There are a variety of standard scores that are all translations of the same scale, based on the mean and the standard deviation. [...] The z-score is the basic, unelaborated standard score from which all others can be derived. The z-score represents, in standard deviation units, the amount a score deviates from the mean of the population from which the score is drawn. The mean of the normal curve is set at zero and the standard deviation unit has a value of one. Scores are stated in term of their distance from the mean as measured in standard deviation units. Scores above the mean have a positive value; those below the mean are negative. Neuropsychological test data can be handled very appropriately in a z-score format.
Elaborations of the z-score are called derived scores. Among the most widely used derived scores are T-scores, which are very popular in educational testing. The T-score has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.” (Lezak et al., 2004)</skos:definition>
